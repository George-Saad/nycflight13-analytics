# nycflight13-analytics
This projesct is an analytical study for NYFlights13 data set which contains all flights take off and landed from/in New York in 2013.

The analytical process focus on flights arrival delay and building prediction models and visuals trying to understand and solve this problem.

Each R script deals with specific problem and deliver different solution. Starting with simple linear regression to predict flights arrival delay then selecting best model and testing it, moving on to classification and building neural network using H2O package to predict delay degree.
Finaly in "arr_delay-prob-per-carrier.r" we calculate the probability of delay for each carrier then produce a plot explaine that.
